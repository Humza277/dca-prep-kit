## About the exam

https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/

## Learning resources

Main resource: https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02

Practice exams (dojo): https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/product/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-practice-exams/

## Active learning

Basic questions for active learning. Start the session by answering all the questions and mark the answers with emojis depending on the result (see the table below).

**Bolded items** are either important to understand or there is high likelihood that they will appear on the exam.

| Answer Status | Description                                                                                                     |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üëç            | You've answered correctly first time, skip repetition for the next session                                      |
| ‚úã            | You've answered the question only partially right, include the question in the next session                     |
| üëé            | You've answered the question wrong and had to lookup the answer. Start from those questions in the next session |

You can easily add emojis to markdown by typing \:emojiname\:

- thumbs up: `:+1:`
- thumbs down: `:-1:`
- hand: `:hand:`

Easiest way to to learn yourself is to:

- clone [this repository](https://github.com/Piotr1215/dca-prep-kit)
- make a copy of [this file](aws_saa_co2.md)
- use this [regex expression](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16880892) to select and remove (replace with empty) all the `<details>` tags (they contain the answers to the questions) `<(details)>(.|\n)*?</details>`, remember to toggle "use regular expressions" in the search box if you are using VS Code. If you are using vim/nvim use this command instead `:g/<details>/,/<\/details>/d _`
- save the file as a learning session, grade yourself for answers
- IMPORTANT: **lookup in the original file if you don't know the answer at all**
- leave the files with dates of each learning session and start next session from the ones you didn't know the answers for
