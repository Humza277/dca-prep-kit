Guided Katacoda Scenario Tour

## Modern Development Challenges

How much Kubernetes do developers need to know? Does "shift left" means
ever-expanding curriculum of tools and frameworks outside of the main focal
point; software development?

Architectures of the past relied on silos and complex processes of hand offs
between development, ops, security and other stakeholders. Modern DevOps
practices encourage us to ‚Äúshift left‚Äù, embrace the ‚Äúyou build it your run it‚Äù
mentality. As the borders between silos became blurred and handoff points are
getting increasingly automated, developers are required to learn and know more
than ever before to fully support the whole lifecycle of a product they are
responsible for.

Development teams became multidisciplinary ‚Äúmini-companies‚Äù that can work for a
very small project but cannot scale to even moderate size. How can we reconcile
between developers taking full ownership of the software they create and other
concerns like operations, security and compliance still being properly addressed
in a standardized way?

The answer is Platform Teams responsible for supporting developers by creating
standardized and reusable services that make it easy for everyone to be
successful with their tasks and increasing demands. The emphasis here is on
reusable services that the Platform Teams provide in form of tools, APIs,
products and contracts.

Let‚Äôs look at how Crossplane Kubernetes Provider can help developers use just
enough Kubernetes to be fully in control of their software and build on company
standards at the same time.

# Kubernetes Simplified

Production grade Kubernetes resources are often complex chunks of YAML with
settings related to security, performance, hardware utilization, observability
and the list goes on.

And this is just a single deployment resource, there are many more to worry
about. Typically, a containerized app running on Kubernetes will require

- deployment
- service
- service account
- roles and cluster roles
- role bindings
- secret
- config map
- network policies
- HPA (horizontal pod autoscaler)

And those are only stateless workflows, for stateful workloads, very often

- volumes
- persistent volume claim
- storage class configuraiton
- stateful sets

And because Kubernetes rarely functions in isolation, you will need to include
multiple CRDs (custom resource definitions) that come along with additional
products like service meshes, observability tech, security scanners and many
many more.

Below you can see an example of a deployment with hardened security settings and
other best practices.

Here is a list of Kubernetes resources commonly used to describe workloads. The
items marked with \* are the ones where developers typically have to interact
with.

Now imagine that those resources will need to be multiplied by the number of
applications/teams/environments and each is likely to have a slight variation to
account for differences in the team governance, tech stack, changes velocity
etc.

By utilizing the
[Kubernetes provider](https://github.com/crossplane-contrib/provider-kubernetes),
it‚Äôs possible to control what Kubernetes resources are being created. It also
enables complexity hiding for developers not familiar with
[Kubernetes Resource Model](https://github.com/Kubernetes/design-proposals-archive/blob/main/architecture/resource-management.md).
In the accompanying Katacoda Scenario and Youtube Video we are deploying a
Kubernetes application consisting of:

- deployment
- service
- horizontal pod autoscaler

Instead of exposing the resources directly to developers who might be
inexperience with Kubernetes, we will create a simple composition containing
only important fields, such as:

- namespace to deploy to
- image with tag

> _Definition describes API for creating a composite resource whereas
> composition defines what managed resources will be created when composite
> resource is created either directly or by a dedicated claim._

Our composition and definition describes what Kubernetes objects we want to
create, but how should developers let us know what should be created? Do they
need to open a Jira ticket? üò∂

‚Ä¶ Nah, they just need to create a simple claim, like so

```yaml
apiVersion: acmeplatform.com/v1alpha1
kind: AppClaim
metadata:
  name: platform-demo
  labels:
    app-owner: piotrzan
spec:
  id: acmeplatform
  compositionSelector:
    matchLabels:
      type: frontend
  parameters:
    namespace: devops-team
    image: piotrzan/nginx-demo:green
```

By applying the claim, we are creating multiple Kubernetes resources ‚Äúunder the
hood‚Äù without needing to know what they are and how they are created. This
concern can be moved onto a Platform Team.

There are several resources created based on the composition.

We can easily update the image, just by changing the image name in the
parameters section of AppClaim.

Deleting the application and underlying resources is as simple as executing the
kubectl command or setting up GitOps and pushing the yaml file to a git repo.

The simplicity was possible thanks to Crossplane‚Äôs composition.

# Crossplane

By utilizing the Kubernetes provider, it‚Äôs possible to control what Kubernetes
resources are being created. It also enables complexity hiding for developers
not familiar with
[Kubernetes Resource Model](https://github.com/kubernetes/design-proposals-archive/blob/main/architecture/resource-management.md).
In this scenario we will deploy a Kubernetes application consisting of:

The below diagram explains Crossplane‚Äôs components and their relations.

What makes Crossplane so special? First, it builds on Kubernetes and capitalizes
on the fact that the real power of Kubernetes is its powerful API model and
control plane logic (control loops). It also moves away from Infrastructure as
Code to Infrastructure as Data. The difference is that IaC means writing code to
describe how the provisioning should happen, whereas IaD means writing pure data
files (in the case of Kubernetes YAML) and submitting them to the control
component (in the case of Kubernetes an operator) to encapsulate and execute the
provisioning logic.

The best part about Crossplane is that it seamlessly enables collaboration
between Application Teams and Platform Teams, by leveraging
[Kubernetes Control](https://containerjournal.com/kubeconcnc/kubernetes-true-superpower-is-its-control-plane/)
Plane as the convergence point where everyone meets.

## Crossplane Kubernetes Provider

Crossplane Kubernetes Provider helps us shift left without overloading
developers with complex operational concerns. Our goal is to help developers and
application teams to focus on reliably and quickly delivering features and
fixing bugs etc. At the same time, there are security and operational concerns
that must be addressed. Those concerns will differ from team to team, from
project to project.

DevOps means lowering friction between developers and other functions. It became
clear that communication between different stakeholders is the key to efficient
collaboration. However, it is very hard to capture the essence of every
discussion with all the nuances and extrapolate it as a pattern to other teams.
The tooling was simply not there. This changes with Crossplane and the workflow
and philosophy it proposes. Now it‚Äôs possible to capture the nuances and
complexity of every scenario and provide a solution where custom and standard
parts are well balanced without falling into the trap of the ‚Äúlowest common
denominator‚Äù.

> _Crossplane workflow and philosophy helps us capture and codify necesarry
> customizations and manage them over time. Now after a meeting between
> developers and platform team, instead of sending email or meeting notes, we
> can create a composition that codifies the decisions from a meeting in the
> form of a contract between developers (claim) and platform team
> (compositions)._

## The Power of Composition

The magic of the Crossplane happens in the
[composition](https://crossplane.io/docs/v1.6/reference/composition.html). There
are 3 main tasks that composition performs

- compose together a set of managed resources based on a claim or composed
  resource
- reference credentials needed for accessing the provider API
- patch/map from values provided in a claim to values in managed resource

Below you can see how composition creates deployment, service and horizontal pod
autoscaler in response to creating the AppClaim. The ‚Äúbinding glue‚Äù between the
composition and actual Kubernetes resource is a composite resource definition
(XRD) which you can think of as a kind of API between the developer consuming
resources via claim and platform engineer or SRE designing the composition for
underlying resources or infrastructure.

Here are 2 key fields that make the composition so powerful.

# forProvider

Specifies Kubernetes resources and settings to be created. In this case, we can
see how the composition adds livenessProbe and readinessProbe as well as
resource limits which might be defined by the Platform Team and thus not exposed
to Application Development Teams.

# Patches

Enables mapping between fields provided in the definition (XRD) and fields in
the Managed Resource (MR).
